# Maze Generation and Solution Project

This comprehensive system is designed for creating, solving, compressing, and visualizing mazes. It utilizes advanced design patterns and multi-threading to efficiently handle mazes in a high-performance computing environment.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into three main components:

1. **Maze Generation and Solution Algorithms**: Implements multiple algorithms for both generating mazes and finding solutions through them.
2. **Client-Server Architecture with Compression**: Efficiently manages maze data transmission using advanced compression techniques to facilitate network transfer.
3. **Desktop Application with MVVM Architecture**: Provides an interactive graphical user interface for real-time maze visualization and manipulation.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Maze Generation Algorithms**: Includes Empty, Simple, and DFS-based algorithms for versatile maze creation.
- **Various Pathfinding Solutions**: Features pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Best-First Search to solve mazes.
- **Efficient Maze Compression**: Optimizes maze data for network transfer, enabling faster and reliable transmission.
- **Multi-threaded Server**: Handles multiple client requests concurrently without performance bottlenecks.
- **Interactive GUI**: Real-time visualization of mazes with responsive user interface controls.

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### 1. Maze Generation and Solution

- **Adapter Pattern**: Facilitates the integration of maze structures with search algorithms via the `SearchableMaze` class.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Supports interchangeable maze generation algorithms for flexibility.
- **Template Method**: Utilized in `AMazeGenerator` for shared maze generation logic.

### 2. Client-Server Architecture

- **Strategy Pattern**: Different server behaviors for maze generation and solving are defined and implemented dynamically.
- **Thread Pool**: Efficient management of concurrent client connections.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances basic I/O streams with compression capabilities to streamline maze data transfer.
- **Caching**: Reuses previously calculated solutions to enhance response times and reduce computational load.

### 3. Desktop Application (MVVM)

- **View**: Manages the graphical user interface and user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Bridges the View with the Model by managing data bindings and encapsulating business logic.
- **Model**: Handles core functionalities including maze operations and data management.

## Technical Implementation

### Maze Compression

- **Simple Compression**: Uses Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for basic data reduction.
- **Advanced Compression**: Incorporates pattern recognition and variable-length encoding for efficient data representation and dictionary-based techniques for recurring patterns.

### Thread Safety

- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Ensures thread-safe operations when caching solutions.
- **ReentrantReadWriteLock**: Protects file operations from concurrent access issues.
- **Thread Pool**: Manages multiple client requests efficiently to optimize resource utilization.

### Search Algorithms

- **BFS**: Explores mazes level by level.
- **DFS**: Prioritizes deep traversal to uncover potential paths.
- **Best-First Search**: Utilizes a heuristic to optimize path selection, with a preference for diagonal movements.
